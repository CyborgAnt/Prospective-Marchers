# Prospective-Marchers
"Prospective Marchers" is where people who want to march or perform on one of the Spring and Summer performance circuits can enter their information into a database. Group Directors can then retrieve this info and contact the prospective marcher about upcoming tryouts, camps, etc.

There are 4 main sections:
a)Main Page - a header with a Hamburger menu, site info, and 'sponsors' (these are not actual page sponsors)
b) Membership Form Page - an HTML form with 'nth-child' CSS styling and a form 'Reset' button
c) Circuits Page - info on the major marching circuits in the United States
d) Contacts and About Me Page - the top half of the page is divided between 'Contacts' (that just link to home pages of the mentioned contacts) and an 'About Me' section. The bottom half of the page is a JavaScript Carousel of various performance groups and what circuits they belong to.
